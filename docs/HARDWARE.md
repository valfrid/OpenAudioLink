# OpenAudioLink Hardware Baseline

## Reference Receiver

```text
ESP32-S3
    -> I²S BCLK/LRCK/DATA
PCM5102A DAC
    -> 3.5 mm stereo line output
```

Expected board supply:

- DAC module VIN: normally 5 V
- I²S logic: 3.3 V
- no external MCLK normally required
- common ground with ESP32

Exact board pinout must be verified before wiring.

## Reference Analog Source

```text
3.5 mm stereo line input
    -> PCM1808 ADC with onboard oscillator
    -> I²S DATA/BCLK/LRCK
ESP32-S3
```

Selected module characteristics:

- 24-bit stereo ADC
- 48 kHz and 96 kHz modes
- onboard audio oscillator
- master/slave selectable
- own power regulation
- 3.5 mm input
- approximately 40 x 50 mm

For OpenAudioLink, the initial target is 24-bit, 48 kHz, stereo.

## Approximate component cost

- ESP32-S3 Super Mini: about 50 SEK
- PCM5102A DAC module: about 28 SEK
- PCM1808 ADC module: about 75 SEK

Approximate node cost before enclosure, supply and connectors:

- Receiver: about 78 SEK
- Analog Source: about 125 SEK

## Temporary development hardware

ESP32-C3 boards already available may be used for early software development.

Use them for control, network and RTP experiments, while keeping the audio abstraction portable to ESP32-S3.

## Initial hardware tests

### DAC test

- generate a 1 kHz sine wave
- output 24-bit/48 kHz I²S
- verify both channels
- measure noise and clipping
- test USB-powered and cleaner external 5 V supply

### ADC test

- capture line input at 24-bit/48 kHz
- verify master/slave configuration
- confirm actual BCLK and LRCK
- measure silence noise floor
- test channel balance
- determine clipping input level

### End-to-end test

- ADC node captures audio
- RTP/UDP transport
- receiver node plays audio
- measure latency, packet loss behaviour and drift
